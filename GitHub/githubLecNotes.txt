❄️ Why github is required ?
#############################
➤ It is a source code management tool and version control tool.
➤ Integrate developers code.
➤ Tracks the history of work.

❄️ Architecture of github 
###########################
👉 Working directory: Contains all the data that is present 
👉 Staging area: Here we put the data that is not selected previously 
👉 Local Repository: The data present in the staging area is send to the local repository.
👉 Remote / central repository: From local repository we add the data to the remote repository so that other people can access our code.

👉 Note: In companies we use personal access tokens to login to the github to connect git with github we will be using the personal access token.
➤ Go to settings  --> Developer settings --> Personal access tokens 
➤ Generate token give the permissions to the token click on generate token now we will we using this token to connect git with github

✨ To unstage the files from the staging area 
***********************************************
➤ We will use this command 
git rm --cached filename

👉 If we want to restore the file to the earlier stage 
********************************************************
➤ Suppose we have updated the file and now we want our previous file back then we will use 
git restore filename 
✅ Note : This command works only after the first commit has been made 
➤ If you have added the file to the staging area and now if you try want to unstage it you have made your first commit also then we can use 
git restore --staged filename  //Use this to unstage the file.

✨ To copy project from the github 
####################################
➤ Use git clone command to copy the project from the github
➤ First get the url of the project in the github open the project click on code you will get the url 
➤ Create a folder and there open gitbash and run git clone url this will clone the project for you.
➤ We will use clone for the first time when we are downloading the project.
