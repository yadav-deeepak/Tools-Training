#############################
❄️ Why github is required ?
#############################
➤ It is a source code management tool and version control tool.
➤ Integrate developers code.
➤ Tracks the history of work.

❄️ Architecture of github 
###########################
👉 Working directory: Contains all the data that is present 
👉 Staging area: Here we put the data that is not selected previously 
👉 Local Repository: The data present in the staging area is send to the local repository.
👉 Remote / central repository: From local repository we add the data to the remote repository so that other people can access our code.

👉 Note: In companies we use personal access tokens to login to the github to connect git with github we will be using the personal access token.
➤ Go to settings  --> Developer settings --> Personal access tokens 
➤ Generate token give the permissions to the token click on generate token now we will we using this token to connect git with github

✨ To unstage the files from the staging area 
***********************************************
➤ We will use this command 
git rm --cached filename

👉 If we want to restore the file to the earlier stage 
********************************************************
➤ Suppose we have updated the file and now we want our previous file back then we will use 
git restore filename 
✅ Note : This command works only after the first commit has been made 
➤ If you have added the file to the staging area and now if you try want to unstage it you have made your first commit also then we can use 
git restore --staged filename  //Use this to unstage the file.

✨ To copy project from the github 
####################################
➤ Use git clone command to copy the project from the github
➤ First get the url of the project in the github open the project click on code you will get the url 
➤ Create a folder and there open gitbash and run git clone url this will clone the project for you.
➤ We will use clone for the first time when we are downloading the project. 

#############
🚀 git pull 
#############
➤ Once we clone the repository then what we do is we do git pull every time we need the updated file. 
➤ It will pull only that code which is not present in our local repository .

##################################
❄️ Concept of branches in github
##################################
➤ Whenever we want to add some new feature to our application or we want to fix some bug we dont work directly on the main branch code 
➤ Main branch code is used for the deployement it is used to run our project so we dont work directly on the main branch because suppose if we start to work directly on main branch and we are developing a feature so if we push the incomplete feature to our main branch it will affect our production server and our code might stop running 
➤ So what we do is we create a clone of project then we create the branch from our main and then we start working on that branch we will push our daily work there this way it wont affect our main branch and when our feature development is complete the tech lead will merge our branch to the main branch.
➤ So like this many branches are created from the main branch and everyone can work parallely on differnt task .
➤ Every on is working on there own branch when they are finished with the task then they will tell the tech lead and he/she will merge the branch to the main branch this way it wont affect the production code and new features are also added .

🌟 How to work on branch
***************************
➤ Using git pull command we will get to know about all the branches that are present in our project.
➤ We will switch to the branch on which we have to work using let us suppose i have to work on bug fix branch so we will do 
git switch bug-fix
➤ This branch is for all the developers who are working on the bug fixing so now we will create a new branch for ourselves and there we will work on the task that is assigned to us.
git branch bug-fix-3456-login-error 
//This will create a new branch named bug-fix-3456-login-error 
➤ We will switch to this branch 
git switch bug-fix-3456-login-error
➤ Now i can work on this branch it will not affect the work of other developers 
👉 Note: After working if we try to push the code to our remote repo it wont be pushed there it will throw an error because the branch the we have created is not present in our remote repo 
➤ We will do 
git push --set-upstream origin bug-fix-3456-login-error

➤ Now we will see this branch in our remote repo and our code will be present there.

➤ Still this code is present in only our branch it is not present in the main branch or bug-fix branch for that merge will be done then only the changes will be deflected to the other branches.
➤ For that our tech lead will tell us to do PR (pull request). We will do the PR and then it will check for the merge conflict if there is no conflict it will merge our code now we can see the changes in our bug-fix branch .

########################################
❄️ What do you mean by git conflict ?
########################################
➤ When two people have modified the same file and the same line according to there needs then the conflict arises.
➤ Suppose developer A has modified line number 12 and developer B has also modified line number 12 so here in this case the conflict will arise.

##############################################
❄️ After commit how can we undo the commit ?
#############################################
➤ To undo the changes from the local repository we will use git reset command
Eg: git reset --soft HEAD~1
➤ So soft reset will help us to undo the commit but the file will be present in the staging area or file wont be removed from the working tree.
Eg: git reset --hard HEAD~1 
➤ This will undo the changes from the local repository but it will also remove the file from the working tree.

########################################
❄️ How to undo your changes in github?
########################################
➤ In order to undo the latest commit on github we will use the command git revert commitId
➤ When we run this command it will open a file where we can write the message and then do esc :wq 
➤ Then do git push 

##################################
❄️ What do you mean by forking ?
##################################
➤ Suppose if you want some code on github and u want to use it then we will do forking it will get that code to your github then we can do the changes that we want to do in it according to our need 
➤ A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project

###########################
❄️ What is collabortor ?
##########################
➤ When we want to allow the other developers to commit on our code and collaborate with them to create a project then we will use collaborator concept .
➤ To provide this authority to other developers to perform the commit on our code : 
settings --> collaborator --> add people  
➤ Search the accounts of people and add them 

##############################################
❄️ Difference between git pull and git fetch
##############################################
➤ git pull : It will help us to get the latest changes that have been done in our repository.
➤ But here also conflict can occur so to solve this problem git fetch came into picture.
➤ Both pull and fetch are used to take latest changes from the remote repository to our system.
➤ Fetch will bring the code from remote repository to local repo only it will not merge the code to the working tree . Now from the local if you want to merge it you can do it manually it is done to avoid the conflicts.
➤ So we will get the code then review it if there are no conflicts then merge the code to working tree .
git merge //use this to merge the code to the working tree.
➤ But in pull you are bring the latest code from the remote repo to local repo and then merge it to the working tree so here conflicts will arise.

###############
❄️ git stash 
##############
➤ It is a command used in Git to temporarily save changes that are not yet committed to work on something else without losing your modifications.
➤ when you run git stash, all your modified but unstaged or staged changes are temporarily stored in a hidden area

example: 
git stash - to store changes in temp area
git stash apply - to get the changes from temp area back

##################
❄️ git cherrypic 
##################
➤ Suppose in you git you have perform 10 commits now if you want to push only some particular commits to the branch then to do it we will be using this command.
➤ git cherry-pick is used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another without merging the entire branch.

Interview Question?

You have done today 5 commits, but you want to merge only 3rd commit to particular branch, how will you do?
Answer: git cherrypic

Note: git merge will merge all the commit to a particular branch
