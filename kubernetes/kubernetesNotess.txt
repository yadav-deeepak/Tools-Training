🌐 What is Kubernetes (K8s)?
###############################
➤ Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform
👉 It helps you manage, deploy, scale, update, and heal containerized applications automatically.

➤ Created by Google, now maintained by CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation).
➤ Think of Kubernetes as a “manager” for your Docker containers — it organizes everything so apps run smoothly at scale.

🚀 Why Do We Use Kubernetes? (Purpose & Benefits)
**************************************************
⭐ 1. Automatic Scaling
=========================
➤ Kubernetes automatically increases or decreases the number of containers based on load.
👉 Example: If your app gets heavy traffic, K8s adds more containers automatically.

⭐ 2. Self-Healing (Auto Recovery)
=====================================
➤ If a container crashes, K8s restarts it automatically.
➤ If a node fails, K8s shifts workloads to healthy nodes.

👉 This ensures your application never goes down.

⭐ 3. Load Balancing
=======================
➤ K8s distributes traffic evenly to all healthy pods.
👉 No server overload problems.

⭐ 4. Easy Deployment & Rollback
==================================
➤ Kubernetes allows:
➤ Rolling updates
➤ Zero downtime deployments
➤ Easy rollback to previous version if something breaks

⭐ 5. Infrastructure Abstraction
==================================
➤ You don’t need to worry about underlying servers.
👉 Kubernetes decides where to run your containers.

⭐ 6. High Availability
=========================
➤ Kubernetes ensures your application stays up 24/7 with multiple replicas.

⭐ 7. Resource Optimization
============================
➤ K8s uses CPU & RAM efficiently by placing containers smartly across nodes.

⭐ 8. Portable Across Clouds
=============================
➤ Kubernetes runs everywhere:
➤ AWS
➤ Azure
➤ GCP
➤ On-premise
➤ Local (Minikube / Kind)

👉 No vendor lock-in.

🎯 In One Line
*****************
➤ Kubernetes = A powerful platform to run, manage, scale, heal, update, and operate containers automatically at any scale.
