🌀 What is Agile?
###################
➤ Definition:
***************
Agile is a project management and software development methodology that focuses on iterative progress, collaboration, and flexibility.
It helps teams deliver small, functional parts of a project quickly and adapt to changes in requirements efficiently.

➤ Key Idea:
************
Instead of delivering the entire project at once (like the traditional Waterfall model), Agile delivers work in small cycles called “iterations” or “sprints” — each lasting 1–4 weeks.

➤ Core Principles (from the Agile Manifesto):
***********************************************
👉 1. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: Constant feedback from customers ensures the product meets real needs.
👉 2. Responding to change over following a plan: Teams quickly adapt when priorities or requirements change.
👉 3. Working software over comprehensive documentation: Focus on delivering usable product increments.
👉 4. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: People and communication are valued more than rigid procedures.

➤ Main Goals of Agile:
***********************
👉 Deliver value to the customer early and frequently.
👉 Improve transparency, communication, and adaptability.
👉 Reduce project risk through continuous feedback and testing.

➤ Agile Process Flow (Simplified):
************************************
1️⃣ Define requirements (user stories)
2️⃣ Plan the sprint (what to build this cycle)
3️⃣ Develop & test
4️⃣ Review with stakeholders
5️⃣ Retrospect (analyze what went well and what didn’t)

➤ Popular Agile Frameworks:
*****************************
👉 Scrum – Works in fixed sprints with roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers.
👉 Kanban – Focuses on continuous delivery using a visual board to track workflow.
👉 Extreme Programming (XP) – Emphasizes technical excellence and continuous improvement.

📘 Agile Terminologies You Must Know
######################################
➤ 1️⃣ Agile Manifesto:
=======================
👉 A set of 4 values and 12 principles that form the foundation of Agile methodology.
👉 It guides how teams should collaborate, adapt, and deliver products.

➤ 2️⃣ Iteration / Sprint:
===========================
👉 A short, fixed period (usually 1–4 weeks) in which a specific set of tasks is planned, developed, tested, and delivered.
👉 Each sprint ends with a working product increment.

➤ 3️⃣ User Story:
===================
👉 A short, simple description of a feature from the end-user’s perspective.
👉 Format: “As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit].”
👉 Example: “As a customer, I want to reset my password so that I can recover my account easily.”

➤ 4️⃣ Product Backlog:
========================
👉 A prioritized list of all features, enhancements, and bug fixes needed for the product.
👉 Managed by the Product Owner.
👉 Items in the backlog are often written as user stories.

➤ 5️⃣ Sprint Backlog:
========================
👉 A subset of the product backlog chosen for a specific sprint.
👉 It contains all the tasks the team commits to complete in that sprint.

➤ 6️⃣ Product Owner (PO):
===========================
👉 Represents the customer or business side.
👉 Responsible for defining the product vision, prioritizing backlog items, and maximizing value.

➤ 7️⃣ Scrum Master:
======================
👉 Acts as a coach/facilitator for the team.
👉 Ensures that the Agile principles are followed and removes impediments (barriers to progress).

➤ 8️⃣ Development Team:
=========================
👉 The group of cross-functional professionals who design, build, and test the product.
👉 Includes developers, testers, designers, etc.

➤ 9️⃣ Increment:
==================
👉 The working product or usable piece of software delivered at the end of each sprint.
👉 It must be potentially shippable.

➤ 🔟 Definition of Done (DoD):
================================
👉 A clear checklist that defines when a user story or task is considered complete.
👉 Example: Code written → tested → reviewed → integrated → deployed.

➤ 1️⃣1️⃣ Burndown Chart:
=========================
👉 A graph that shows how much work remains in the sprint.
👉 Helps track progress and predict if the team will finish on time.

➤ 1️⃣2️⃣ Velocity:
===================
👉 The amount of work a team can complete in one sprint, usually measured in story points.
👉 Used to forecast future sprints.

➤ 1️⃣3️⃣ Daily Stand-up (Daily Scrum):
=======================================
👉 A short 15-minute daily meeting where team members discuss:
➤ What they did yesterday
➤ What they will do today
➤ Any blockers or issues

➤ 1️⃣4️⃣ Sprint Review:
========================
👉 Conducted at the end of a sprint to demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.

➤ 1️⃣5️⃣ Sprint Retrospective:
================================
👉 A meeting after each sprint where the team discusses what went well, what didn’t, and what can be improved.

➤ 1️⃣6️⃣ Epic:
===============
👉 A large user story that can be broken down into multiple smaller stories.
👉 Example: “User Management” could be an epic with smaller stories like login, signup, and reset password.

➤ 1️⃣7️⃣ Story Points:
=======================
👉 A relative measure used to estimate the effort, complexity, and time required for a user story.
👉 Teams often use Fibonacci series (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …) for estimation.

➤ 1️⃣8️⃣ Kanban Board:
=======================
👉 A visual tool that displays work items in different stages like To Do → In Progress → Done.
👉 Helps track progress and manage workflow easily.

📄 Difference Between Requirements and User Story
###################################################
➤ Although both describe what needs to be built, they differ in style, purpose, and approach — especially in Agile vs traditional methodologies.

➤ 1️⃣ Definition:
********************
👉 Requirement:
=================
A formal, detailed description of a system’s behavior, feature, or function.
Used in traditional (Waterfall) projects.

👉 User Story:
================
A short, simple statement written from the end-user’s point of view describing what they want and why.
Used in Agile projects.

➤ 2️⃣ Format:
**************
👉 Requirement: Usually written as –
======================================
“The system shall allow users to log in using their email and password.”

👉 User Story: Written as –
=============================
“As a user, I want to log in using my email and password so that I can access my account.”

➤ 3️⃣ Purpose:
***************
👉 Requirement: Focuses on what the system should do.
👉 User Story: Focuses on what the user needs and why.

➤ 4️⃣ Level of Detail:
************************
👉 Requirement: Detailed, technical, and often includes constraints, rules, and acceptance criteria in depth.
👉 User Story: High-level and lightweight; details are added during discussion with the team.

➤ 5️⃣ Ownership:
*****************
👉 Requirement: Typically written and managed by a Business Analyst or Project Manager.
👉 User Story: Written and managed by the Product Owner with help from the Agile Team.

➤ 6️⃣ Flexibility:
*******************
👉 Requirement: Usually fixed once approved — difficult to change later.
👉 User Story: Flexible — can evolve as customer feedback and priorities change.

➤ 7️⃣ Focus:
**************
👉 Requirement: System-focused — describes system capabilities.
👉 User Story: User-focused — describes user goals and value.
