❄️ Scrum team 
###############
➤ It is basically a team of small small size of 6-9 consists of developers & testers
➤ Every scrum team we have to take them to this grooming meeting.

####################
❄️ Sprint planning
####################
➤ Here we will decide to build the user stories how much time will it take .
Eg: If sprint duration is 2 weeks then that means the time given to complete the user story is given as 2 weeks and we have to finish the task within that period.
➤ Here we also decide which user stories are going to be put into the sprint backlog.
➤ We will look at the complexity points and based on that an estimated time is allocated to complete that user story.
➤ The user stories that I am going to put in the sprint backlogs are the ones that are going to be developed.
➤ Like this each scrum team has its sprint backlog and each of them have a time allocated to them when they start the development the timer starts and they have to complete the work given to them within the given number of days.
