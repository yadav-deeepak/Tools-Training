🚀 What is Apache Kafka?
##########################
➤ Apache Kafka is an open-source, distributed event streaming platform developed by LinkedIn and later donated to the Apache Software Foundation.
It is designed to handle real-time data feeds with high throughput, fault tolerance, and scalability.

⚙️ Simple Definition
***********************
➤ Kafka is like a messaging system that allows different applications to communicate with each other by sending and receiving messages (data) in real time.

👉 Example:
------------
Imagine you have a shopping app —
➤ When a user places an order, that event is sent to Kafka.
➤ Different services like Payment Service, Inventory Service, and Notification Service consume that event to perform their tasks immediately.

💡 Core Idea
**************
➤ Kafka works as a publish–subscribe model:
👉 Producers publish (send) data to topics.
👉 Consumers subscribe (read) data from topics.
👉 Brokers store and manage those topics.

⚡ Why Kafka? (Key Features)
******************************
➤ High Throughput: Can process millions of messages per second.
➤ Scalability: Easily add more brokers or partitions without downtime.
➤ Fault Tolerance: Replicates data across multiple brokers to prevent data loss.
➤ Durability: Stores messages on disk — so even if a system crashes, data isn’t lost.
➤ Real-Time Processing: Ideal for streaming data pipelines and event-driven architectures.

🧩 Use Cases
**************
➤ Real-Time Analytics (e.g., tracking user activity on websites)
➤ Log Aggregation (collecting logs from multiple servers)
➤ Messaging Queue Replacement (alternative to RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ)
➤ Data Streaming Pipelines (connecting databases, microservices, etc.)
➤ Event-Driven Microservices (services communicate via Kafka events)

🏗️ Apache Kafka Architecture
###############################
➤ Kafka’s architecture is designed to handle large volumes of streaming data efficiently and reliably. Let’s break it down 👇

⚙️ 1. Producer
****************
➤ A Producer is any application that sends (publishes) messages or data to a Kafka Topic.
👉 Example: An e-commerce app sending “Order Placed” events to Kafka.

➤ Producers decide:
Which topic to send the message to.
Which partition within that topic to send it (either automatically or using a key).

🧱 2. Broker
**************
➤ A Broker is a Kafka server that stores data and handles read/write requests from producers and consumers.

👉 Each broker can handle thousands of partitions and millions of messages.
👉 Multiple brokers form a Kafka Cluster to share load and provide fault tolerance.

➤ Example:
If you have 3 brokers (Broker 1, Broker 2, Broker 3), Kafka automatically distributes data among them.

🧩 3. Topic
*************
➤ A Topic is a category or stream name where messages are published.
👉 Example: “user-signup”, “order-events”, or “payment-updates”.

➤ Topics are split into multiple partitions for scalability.

🔄 4. Partition
******************
➤ A Partition is a unit of parallelism in Kafka.
Each topic is divided into partitions, and each partition is an ordered sequence of messages.

👉 Example:
Topic: orders

Partition 0 → messages [offset 0, 1, 2...]
Partition 1 → messages [offset 0, 1, 2...]

➤ More partitions → more parallel processing by consumers.

📦 5. Offset
***************
➤ Each message in a partition has a unique offset (like a line number).
👉 It represents the position of the message in that partition.

➤ Consumers use offsets to track which messages they have already processed.

👥 6. Consumer
****************
➤ A Consumer is an application that reads messages from Kafka topics.
➤ Consumers subscribe to one or more topics and process data in real time.

👥 7. Consumer Group
**********************
➤ A Consumer Group is a collection of consumers that work together to consume messages from a topic.
👉 Each partition is read by only one consumer in a group → ensures parallelism and no duplicate processing.

Example:
If you have 3 partitions and 3 consumers in a group → each consumer reads from one partition.

🧠 8. Zookeeper (Older versions) / Kafka Controller (Newer versions)
*********************************************************************
➤ In older Kafka versions, Zookeeper manages cluster metadata — like broker info, leader election, and topic configuration.
➤ In newer Kafka versions (v2.8+), Kafka’s internal controller replaces Zookeeper for simpler management.

🔁 Data Flow Summary
**********************
1️⃣ Producer sends data → Topic (divided into partitions)
2️⃣ Kafka Brokers store the data.
3️⃣ Consumers (in a consumer group) read data from those partitions.

🧭 Example Flow
=================
➤ OrderService produces “order-created” event → Topic: orders.
➤ InventoryService and PaymentService consume from that topic → take real-time action.
