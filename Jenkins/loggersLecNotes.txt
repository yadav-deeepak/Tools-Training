❄️ What is logging ?
######################
➤ Logging is the process of recording the application's activity, errors, and other useful information into a file(or console). These records are called as log message.

✅ Why is Logging Important?
###################################

1. Understand Application Behavior
➤ Logs help you know what the application is doing at each step.

Example: “Server started”, “User logged in”, “Order placed”, etc.

2. Find Root Cause of Errors
➤ If your app crashes or throws an error, the logs can show what exactly happened and where.

Example: NullPointerException at line 52 in a log tells you exactly where the code failed.

3. Debugging in Production
➤ You can’t always open a code editor in a live app. But with logs, you can see what’s going wrong without stopping the app.

4. Security & Auditing
➤ You can track who accessed what, which can be useful for security checks or user activity monitoring.

💬 Real Life Analogy
##############################
➤ Imagine you run a delivery business. You keep a diary of:
a. Orders taken
b. Orders packed
c. Orders delivered
d. Complaints

➤ Later, if a customer says, “I never got my package,” you check your diary (log) to find what happened. This is exactly how logs work in software.
